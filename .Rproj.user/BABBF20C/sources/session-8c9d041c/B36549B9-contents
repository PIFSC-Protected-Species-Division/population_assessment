### Summary

Population assessments are used to inform management by quantifying the negative impact of threats or the positive impact of conservation actions on the long term growth rate and abundance of a population. In this assessment, we examine the impacts of three longline fisheries (the Hawaiʻi-based shallow-set longline fleet, the Hawaiʻi-based deep-set longline fishery, and the American Samoa-based deep-set longline fishery) on two sea turtle species. We estimate the trends and abundance of both North Pacific (NP) loggerhead turtles (*Carretta carretta*) and the western Pacific (WP) leatherback turtle (*Dermochelys coriacea*) based on nesting data. The analysis presented here builds on two NOAA Technical Memorandums ([NOAA-TM-NMFS-PIFSC-95](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/23037) and [NOAA-TM-NMFS-PIFSC-101](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/24251)) which estimated the impact of the three fisheries above on both NP loggerheads and WP leatherbacks. The goal of this project is to (1) update the previous population assessments with the latest data, (2) expand the population assessment to also capture the positive impact of conservation actions, and (3) provide an open-access workflow of for this population assessment method to be reproduced for other species or regions.
