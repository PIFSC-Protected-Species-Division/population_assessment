PVA is\nmathematical model that uses demographic and life history data to\npredict the long-term trend of a population, and its sensitivity to\nchanges in life history parameters or environmental stochasticity. This\nallows users to assess the long-term impact of current threats, such as\nfisheries bycatch, or conservation actions, such as nesting beach\nprotections.\n\n## Conceptual Framework\n\nPVA combines two primary components:\n\n1.  **Retrospective fitting:** Estimating historical trends and current\n    nesting female abundance based on empirical data.\n2.  **Future projections:** A simulation approach to evaluate\n    projections against abundance thresholds (the probability of falling\n    below either 50%, 25%, or 12.5% of the current population size).\n\n## Methods Outline\n\nThis assessment was performed in a **Bayesian framework** with four main\ncomponents: nesting data imputation, nesting trend analysis, population\nviability analysis, and incorporation of fishery take into the PVA (the\n\"take model\" component). The Bayesian framework is a statistical method\nfor combining a prior probability (existing knowledge) with new data\n(likelihood) to produce a revised posterior probability. Instead of\nusing just a single estimate for a PVA, it provides a posterior\ndistribution that quantifies the uncertainty of parameters.\n\n### 1. Imputing monthly nest counts\n\nSome months were missing from the leatherback dataset, so we used a\nBayesian hierarchical model to impute the missing monthly nest counts.\nThis assumes that the dataset contains observed nests, but these values\ndo not fully capture the true number of nests, as not all nests were\nobserved. The relationship between the monthly nest counts recorded on\nthe beach in natural log space ($\\text{y}_{t,m}$) and the natural log of\nthe true number of nests $\\text{X}_{t,m}$ will be explained below:\n\nWe model the natural logarithm (natural log) of monthly counts at a\nnesting beach as an auto-regressive model. $$\n\\text{u}_{t,m} = \\text{s}_{t,m} + \\text{X}_{t-1,m-1}\n$$ $\\text{u}_{t,m}$ is the mean of the natural log of the true number of\nnests at time $t$ of month $m$, $\\text{s}_{t,m}$ is the \"slope\"\nparameter at time $t$, which is defined by month ($m$ = 1 to 12).\n$\\text{X}_{t-1,m}$ is the natural log of the true nest count at time\n$t - 1$. While month index $m$ corresponds to sequential months in each\nnesting season (e.g. months 1 through 12), the time index starts at the\nfirst month of the time series and increases monthly throughout all\nyears in the time series.\n\nThe state-space $\\text{X}_{t,m}$ is modeled with a normal distribution\nwith the mean $\\text{u}_{t,m}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_X$, which\nwas assumed to be constant over time. $$\n\\text{X}_{t,m} \\text~N(\\text{u}_{t,m},\\sigma_X)\n$$ Observations $\\text{y}_{t,m}$ are modeled with another normal\ndistribution with standard deviation $\\sigma_y$. also assumed to be\nconstant over time. $$\n\\text{y}_{t,m} \\text~N(\\text{X}_{t,m},\\sigma_y)\n$$ The slope $\\text{s}_{t,m}$ parameters are modeled with the discrete\nFourier series y acknowledging the periodicity of nesting. For Jamursba\nMedi, a 12-month period captures the single summer peak in nesting,\nwhereas the summer and winter peaks of nesting in Wermon are captured by\na 6-month period. $$\n\\text{s}_{t,m} = \\beta_1 * cos(2\\pi(\\frac{m}{period})) + \\beta_2 * sin(2\\pi(\\frac{m}{period}) \n$$ The two coefficients ($\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$) were estimated from\nthe data. The annual number of nests for each season (April through\nMarch; $X_T$) are computed as the sum of estimated true monthly log\nnumbers of nests ($\\text{X}_{t,m}$), derived from imputed log observed\nnest counts ($\\text{y}_{t,m}$). $$\nX_T = \\sum{exp(\\text{X}_{.,m}})\n$$ $\\text{X}_{.,m}$ indicates all $t$ values from $m$ = 1 to $m$ = 12.\n\nPrior distributions for the parameters are not flat but with large\nuncertainties in the natural log space. Normal distributions with mean =\n0 and variance = 1 are used for the two parameters for the Fourier\ndiscrete function ($\\beta_1, \\beta_2$), whereas gamma distributions with\nthe shape parameter = 2 and rate parameter = 0.5 are used for the\nstandard deviation parameters for the process ($\\sigma_X$) and\nobservation ($\\sigma_y$) models.\n\n### 2. Trend analysis (retrospective)\n\nPopulation growth rates are estimated using a stochastic\ndensity-independent exponential growth model applied to nest count data\n(Boyd et al. 2017[^1], Holmes et al. (2007)[^2]. $$\nN_j = \\text{N}_{j-1}e^r\n$$ $N_j$ is the number of Annual Nesters in the year $j$, $r$ is the\ninstantaneous population growth rate (i.e. long-term annual trend), and\n$e^r$ = $\\lambda$ (i.e., \"lambda\", the finite rate of increase for the\npopulation).\n\n[^1]: Boyd, C., D. P. DeMaster, R. S. Waples, E. J. Ward, and B. L.\n    Taylor. 2017. Consistent extinction risk assessment under the US\n    Endangered Species Act. Conservation Letters 10:328-336.\n\n[^2]: Holmes EE, Sabo JL, Viscido SV, Fagan WF. 2007. A statistical\n    approach to quasi‐extinction forecasting. Ecology Letters.\n    10(12):1182-1198.\n\nThis model is common for long-lived, slow-growing, late-maturing species\nsuch as sea turtles, whose populations have been depleted to relatively\nlow levels. The assumption of density-independence could be evaluated in\nfuture by running a density-dependent model (e.g. Gompertz model), which\nwould allow the population to reach carrying capacity at some point in\nthe future.\n\nThe data inputs to the model were the time series of Annual Nesters, or\nthe number of females arriving on a beach to nest each year. These were\nderived from observed nest counts, by dividing each nest count by mean\nclutch frequency (i.e. the mean number of clutches per nesting female in\na nesting season). This static conversion does not affect the estimation\nprocess, but puts results into management-relevant terms. The number of\nAnnual Nesters summed across one remigration interval (i.e. the number\nof years between nesting events of the same female) yields a snapshot of\nthe Total Nesters in the population.\n\nThe trend estimates here are better interpreted as long-term annual\ntrends in the number of nesters, rather than the true population growth\nrates. This is because the model relies exclusively on nest count data,\nnesters only represent a small portion of the total population that\nincludes males and immature turtles of both sexes, and assuming true\npopulation growth rates would require the assumption of a stable age\ndistribution, for which no data exists.\n\nThe exponential growth rate was transformed into natural log space and\nsolved for the population growth rate: $$\nln(N_j) = ln(\\text{N}_{j-1}) + r\n$$ $$\nr = ln(N_j) - ln(\\text{N}_{j-1})\n$$ Following Boyd et al. (2017)[^3], we construct a Bayesian state-space\nmodel (BSSM) from the natural log version of the exponential population\ngrowth equation. The BSSM allows for estimation of process variation\n(i.e., environmental and demographic variability) and observation\nuncertainty (i.e., imperfect data collection) and provides posterior\ndistributions (i.e., parameter estimates with probability distributions)\nwhich are useful for conveying uncertainty in management applications.\n\n[^3]: Boyd, C., D. P. DeMaster, R. S. Waples, E. J. Ward, and B. L.\n    Taylor. 2017. Consistent extinction risk assessment under the US\n    Endangered Species Act. Conservation Letters 10:328-336.\n\nThere are two major components of the BSSM: the process model describing\nthe true number of nesting females each year, and the observation model\nrelating the observed count data to the true number of nesting females.\nThree parameters are estimated: $r$, the instantaneous population growth\nrate, $Q$, the process error variance, and $R$, the observation error\nvariance. The model also provides a predicted count with a probability\ndistribution for each year of observed data. The predicted value for the\nfinal year of observed data is then used as a starting point for future\nprojections.\n\n$$\n\\text{Process equation:}\\quad {T_j = \\text{T}_{j-1} + r + p_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; p_j \\,\\text ~\\, N(0,Q)\n$$ Where $T_j$ is the natural log of the true number of annual nesters\nin year $j$, $r$ is the instantaneous population growth rate, $p_j$ is\nthe process error at year $j$, and $Q$ is the state process (time\ninvariant). The true state variable, $T_j$ is not directly measured for\nthe MP loggerheads nor WP leatherbacks. Instead, nest counts are\nobserved on multiple beaches for each population, and the resulting time\nseries come with various forms of observation uncertainty (i.e., missed\nnests or falsely identified nests). The relationship between the\nobserved data and the corresponding number of true Annual Nesters is\ndefined by a second equation: $$\n\\text{Observation equation:}\\quad {B_j = T_j + o_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; o_j \\,\\text ~\\, N(0,R)\n$$ where $B_j$ is the natural log of the observed nesters, $o_j$ is the\nobservation error at year $j$, and $R$ is the variance of the\nobservation process (time invariant).\n\nFor both NP loggerheads and WP leatherbacks, we define the model to only\nhave one population with multiple time series of observations (i.e.,\nmultiple beaches).This structure best represents the known population\ndynamics of genetic similarity and exchange of individuals across the\nstudied beaches.\n\nHowever, the basic model can be expanded to accommodate multiple state\nvectors, representing several populations and multiple time series\n(Hinrichsen and Holmes 2009[^4]): $$\n\\text{Process equation:}\\quad {T_j = \\text{T}_{j-1} + r + p_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; p_j \\,\\text ~\\, MVN(0,Q_j)\n$$ $$\n\\text{Observation equation:}\\quad {B_j = Z +T_j + a + o_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; o_j \\,\\text ~\\, MVN(0,R_j)\n$$ where $Q_j$ is the process variance-covariance matrix, $R_j$ is the\nobservation variance-covariance matrix, $Z$ is a matrix that maps sets\nof time series to the set of state vectors, and $a$ is a vector of\nscaling parameters. The multivariate setting would allow the analysis of\neach time series as an individual population.\n\n[^4]: Hinrichsen R, Holmes EE. 2009. Using multivariate state-space\n    models to study spatial structure and dynamics. Spatial\n    Ecology.145-166.\n\nPosterior distributions of the model parameters are numerically derived\nusing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in JAGS (Plummer,\n2003[^5]; 2017[^6]).The MCMC simulations are based on 10,000 samples of\n2 chains. Every other sample was retained to reduce auto-correlation,\nand the first 1000 samples of each chain were discarded as burn-in.\n\n[^5]: Plummer M. 2003.

Vienna,\n    Austria.\n\n[^6]: Plummer M. 2017. Jags version 4.3.0 user manual.\n    http://mcmc-jagssourceforgenet/.\n\nFrom the model outputs, we are most interested in $r$, the annual\npopulation growth rate, $Q$, the process variance, and\n$\\text{T}_{final}$, the estimated true log Annual Nesters for the final\nyear of observed data. Posterior distributions of Annual Nesters for the\nfinal found years of data are used to estimate current abundance: $$\n\\text{N}_{current} = \\frac{RI * (e^{\\text{T}_{final}})+(e^{\\text{T}_{final-1}})+(e^{\\text{T}_{final-2}})+(e^{\\text{T}_{final-3}})}{4}\n$$ where $RI$ is the remigration interval for the population and\n$\\text{N}_{final}$ is the median Annual Nesters estimated for the final\nyear of data, $\\text{N}_{final-1}$ is for the second to final year of\ndata, and so on. This serves as a snapshot of Total Reproductive Females\nin the population, and assumes no mortaily of adults females during the\n$RI$ period.\n\n### 3. Trend analysis: future projections\n\nPVA projections use a simulation approach with 10,000 runs for each\nspecies. Each projection is initialized in its starting year with a\npaired draw from the MCMC samples (joint posterior distribution) for (1)\nAnnual Nesters ($N_0$ = $\\text{N}_{final}$), (2) instantaneous\npopulation growth rate ($r$), (3) process error variance ($Q$) from the\nfinal data year of the historic trend analysis. For each subsequent year\nin the projection, a new $r$ and $Q$ are drawn as pairs from the MCMC\nsamples to make the projections dynamic. Pulling paired draws from the\nMCMC samples reflects the inter-annual variation in the biology of the\nspecies, but also constrains parameter values to realistic combinations\nand therefore keeps the uncertainty in the projections reasonable.\n\nProjections can be evaluated against abundance thresholds. Here, the\nprobability of falling below 50%, 25%, and 12.5% of current population\nsize ($N_0$) is calculated at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year time steps by\nsumming the number of projections below the thresholds at the given time\nstep and dividing by the total number of projections (10,000). Mean,\nmedian, and 95% confidence limits of number of years to reach the\nthreshold are calculated for simulations that fall below a given\npopulation threshold, and the 100-year timestep simulation.\n\n### 4. Incorporating fishery interactions into the model\n\nIn principle, the incorporation of fisheries interactions into the PVA\nprojections is simple: during the calculation of the number of females\nin the next time step ($\\text{N}_{j+1}$), the number of females in the\ncurrent time step ($N_j$) is reduced by the incidental take in the\ncurrent time step ($F_j$) and multiplied by the finite population growth\nrate ($\\lambda$, = $e^r$). $$\n\\text{N}_{j+1} = (N_j - F_j) * e^r\n$$ Therefore, the challenge comes from converting the incidental take of\na given species (comprised of various lengths, ages, life stages, and\nsexes) to adult nester equivalents (ANE).\n\n**1. Predicting anticipated take levels:** The first goal is to generate\nthe number and characteristics of the anticipated turtles that will be\ntaken in each year. The number of turtles is referred to as the\nanticipated take level (ATL). Each year's ATL was drawn from a\nConway-Maxwell Poisson distribution (CMP), a two-parameter version of\nthe Poisson distributions that includes a scale parameter $\\nu$.\n$\\mu_{s,j}$ is the mean of the CMP distribution, and $s$ is one of three\nwithin-year segments which are summed to produce the total annual ATL\n(McCracken 2018[^7]). $$\n\\text{ATL}_{j} \\; \\text~ \\sum^{3}_{s=1}{CMP(\\mu_{s,j},\\nu_{s,j})}\n$$ Each individual in the annual ATL receives (1) a length and fishery\nmortality from a bivariate normal distribution, (2) a back-calculated\nage with years until maturity based on a von Bertalanffy growth model,\n(3) juvenile survival rate, (4) sex, and (5) a remigration interval.\n\n[^7]: McCracken ML. 2018. Hawaii permitted shallow-set longline fishery\n    estimated anticipated take level for Endangered Species Act listed\n    species. In: NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Science Center, editor.\n    Honolulu, HI USA\n\n**2. Lengths and fishery mortality.** Based on historic incidental take,\na bivariate normal distribution is used to generate lengths in\nlogarithmic space and assign fishery mortality in logit space.\n$\\theta_{L,j}$ is a linear function of the annual incidental take\n($F_j$) with intercept $a_0$ and slope $a_1$, and $\\sum$ is the\nvariance-covariance matrix with variances $\\sigma_L^2$ and $\\sigma_D^2$\nfor the log lengths (log($L_k$)) and logit assigned fishery mortality\n(logit($D_k$)) to have correlated draws. The parameters of the\nmultivariate normal distribution\n($a_0, a_1, \\sigma_L, \\sigma_D, \\rho_{L,D}$) are solved for in a\nBayesian framework using STAN via RStan with 7,500 simulations per chain\n(5,000 burn-in, 2,500 retained) with 4 chains. $$\n\\left( \\frac{log(L_k)}{logit(D_k)} \\right) \\;\\text~MVN\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{L,j}}{\\theta_D},\\;\\scriptstyle\\sum\\;\\right)\n$$ $$\n\\theta_{L,j} = a_0 + a_1F_j\n$$\n\n$$\n\\scriptstyle\\sum = \\left[\\frac {\\sigma_L^2}{}{\\rho_{L,d}{}} \\right]\n$$ $$\n\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathrm{\\sigma_L^2} & \\mathrm{{\\rho_{L,D}}{\\sigma_{L}{\\sigma_{D}} \\\\\n\\mathrm{{\\rho_{L,D}}{\\sigma_L}{\\sigma_D}} & \\mathrm{\\sigma_D^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3. Age and stage.** From all lengths of historically taken turtles, a\nvon Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) is used to calculate the expected\nlength at age across the range of lengths for each species. Using the\nVBGM for each species, the age at maturity ($A_{mat}$) was assumed to\ncorrespond to a length of 97.5% of the maximum asymptotic maximum length\n($L_\\infty$). Turtles with ages less than $A_{mat}$ or lengths less than\n97.5% of ($L_\\infty$) are considered immature. Years until maturity are\ncalculated for all turtles as $Y_k = A_{mat} - {A_k}$, where $A_k$ is\nthe age of the $k$th individual.\n\n**4. Remigration interval, juvenile survival, and sex.** In\ndeterministic runs, each individual in the anticipated take is assigned\nthe mean remigration interval ($RI$) and the mean juvenile survival\n($\\phi$). In stochastic runs, each individual's $RI$ is drawn from a\ndistribution (CMP for leatherbacks, truncated normal for loggerheads)\nand their juvenile survival is drawn from a normal distribution. The sex\nof each animal is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution for the\nprobability of being female.\n\n**5. ANE calculation.** Adults in the anticipated take are given ANEs\nof 1. Juvenile ANEs are calculated by projecting the juvenile survival\nover the number of years to maturity, and dividing by remigration\ninterval. The stochastic nature of sex ratio and fishery mortality are\napplied to adjust the individual ANE. The probability of an individual\ntaken by a fishery dying is used with a Bernoulli distribution to\nsimulate whether an individual dies. Therefore, the ANE of the $k$th\nindividual is computed such that when the individual was a juvenile,\nfemale, and ended up dying, ANE was defined as the first equation below.\nHowever, when the individual was adult and either male or ends up alive,\nthe ANE equals 0.\n\n$$\nANE_k = \\frac{\\phi_J^{Y_k}}{RI}\n$$ $$\nANE_{realized,k} = \\{{{\\frac{\\phi_J^{Y_k}}{RI}, Stage = J}\\atop{1 \\times Sex \\times Discard, Stage = A}}\n$$ **5. Historical ANE imputation.** To account for the historical\nimpact on the population growth rates, ANE is also calculated\nhistorically. Each turtle's length is used to generate a likely age,\nstage, and years to maturity. Juveniles' years to maturity are rounded\nto the nearest year, and adults are assumed to be nesting in the year of\ntheir fishery interaction. $Y_F$ is the year incidental take occurred,\n$Y_k$ is the yeras to maturity, RI is the remigration interval (rounded\nto 3 years). The survival probability between each nesting year has to\nbe accounted for so that the initial ANE is adjusted, where $\\phi_J$ and\n$\\phi_A$ are juvenile and adult survival rates, $PF$ is the proportion\nfemales, and $D$ is the assigned fishery mortality. $$\nY_{nest,k} = \\{{{Y_F+Y_k, y=1}\\atop{Y_{nest,k}-1+RI, y>1}}\n$$ $$\nANE_{k,j} = \\{{{{\\phi_J^{Nest_1}}\\times{PF} \\times D_k, y = 1}\\atop{{\\phi_A^{RI}, y>1}}}\n$$ **6. Take calculation.** After converting all individuals to ANEs,\ntake ($F_j$) from the earlier equation is substituted out for the\nsummation of the individual ANEs in a given year. To account to process\nvariance $Q$ from the trend analysis, the first equation below is\nmodified to draw $N_{j+1}$ from a normal distribution. The modified\npopulation growth model presented below is used as the basis for the\nfuture projections described above to produce future scenarios with take\nincorporated. $$\n\\text{N}_{j+1} = (N_j - ANE_{realized,j}) * e^r\n$$ $$\n\\text{N}_{j+1} = N((N_j - ANE_{realized,j}) * e^r, Q)\n$$\n\n### 5. Modeling assumptions\n\n**Imputation:**\n\n1.  The true number of nests per month is distributed normally, where\n    the monthly means can be modeled with a discrete Fourier series with\n    a fixed annual frequency. In other words, the number of peaks within\n    a year is constant over the years. The variance around the means is\n    assumed constant over the years.\n\n2.  We used an autoregressive model with a lag of one month (AR1 model)\n    where the relationship between the numbers of nests in two months is\n    modeled by the Fourier series. We assume this model sufficiently\n    captures the cyclical nature of nesting throughout the year.\n\n**Trend:**\n\n1.  The proportion of total nests observed on a given beach is constant\n    through time.\n\n2.  The time series of observed number of annual nesters are\n    representative of the populations, as are the population growth\n    rates observed for nesters. Note that index beaches are typically\n    identified for long-term monitoring because they represent the\n    population well.\n\n3.  The clutch frequency is constant through time.\n\n4.  The population growth rate is density-independent for each species\n    (i.e., no carrying capacity or Allee effects in the timeframe\n    considered).\n\n5.  The population growth rate is the same across the different beaches\n    for each species (i.e., there is a single biological process\n    resulting in a single trend).\n\n6.  The process and observation variances are estimable (with so few\n    beaches, the prior has a lot of influence).\n\n7.  The index beaches in both Japan and Indonesia were observed with\n    constant effort or were effort-corrected by the data collectors\n    prior to being provided to PIFSC to form the time series used in\n    these analyses.\n\n8.  The remigration interval is constant through time.\n\n**Projections:**\n\n1.  The population will face the same threats in the future as it did in\n    the past. The PVA applies the population growth rate from the past,\n    which was influenced by some particular magnitude of threats, to the\n    future trajectory of the population. It does not account for the\n    impacts of new or increasing threats, such as the loss of nesting\n    habitat from climate change.\n\n**Take model:**\n\n1.  The anticipated take level (ATL) is constant through time and\n    independent of fishery effort. This assumption was made by\n    McCracken (2018) when generating the ATLs for the fishery.\n\n2.  The distribution of turtles’ sizes and post-interaction mortalities\n    in the past is representative of what will be encountered in the\n    future. We make this assumption when we use the fisheries observer\n    data to inform characteristics of future turtles taken by the\n    fishery, and do so because these are the best available data for the\n    task.\n\n3.  The life history parameters are indicative of the populations of\n    interest and are estimated accurately. Specifically, Amat(age at\n    maturity) is 0.975 of Linf (asymptotic length; average length of\n    mature females).\n\n4.  Turtles will nest immediately once they reach maturity.\n\n### 6. Conservation implications\n\nWe made a number of decisions in the analyses that were inherently\nconservative for the turtle species in question (i.e., likely inflated\nthe mortality relative to the true). We highlight those here to provide\ncontext for interpretation:\n\n1.  We applied the entire anticipated take for the fishery in future\n    years to the index beaches for which we had data; however, those\n    index beaches represent only 52% and 75% of the nesting populations\n    for loggerheads and leatherbacks, respectively. Assessing the impact\n    of the entire take on the index beach populations rather than the\n    full populations is conservative for the species.\n\n2.  The Bayesian trend analysis accounts for the parameter uncertainty\n    by incorporating estimated uncertainty of demographic parameters.\n    Consequently, we found large uncertainty around the estimated\n    population growth rate (r), which resulted in greater or lesser\n    chance of recovering than what was found from a frequentist\n    approach. This finding provides an accurate assessment of the\n    projected population given what we know about the population.\n\n3.  The anticipated take level is biased high (the CMP distribution\n    tends to draw ATLs that are higher than the take levels observed in\n    previous years).\n\n4.  In calculating Adult Nester Equivalents (ANEs) in our historical\n    analysis of fishery impacts (see Historical ANE Imputation), we\n    assume that nesters would have repeatedly returned to nest at a\n    constant remigration interval with an annual probability of survival\n    equal to 0.89 for leatherbacks and 0.90 for loggerheads. However,\n    for loggerheads, Japanese colleagues have indicated that nesters\n    have a relatively low probability of being observed nesting in\n    future years after their initial sighting (approximately 0.30),\n    suggesting potentially high threats in the marine environment. If\n    this is true, then the ANE values in our historical analysis (see\n    Historical ANE Imputation) are inflated compared to the true ANE\n    values (i.e., we added back loggerhead nesters to the population\n    when in reality they had a low chance of surviving to the next\n    nesting season).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Population assessments\n\n**Population viability analysis (PVA)** is a conservation tool used to\nhelp managers assess extinction risk and guide policy decisions. PVA is\nmathematical model that uses demographic and life history data to\npredict the long-term trend of a population, and its sensitivity to\nchanges in life history parameters or environmental stochasticity. This\nallows users to assess the long-term impact of current threats, such as\nfisheries bycatch, or conservation actions, such as nesting beach\nprotections.\n\n## Conceptual Framework\n\nPVA combines two primary components:\n\n1.  **Retrospective fitting:** Estimating historical trends and current\n    nesting female abundance based on empirical data.\n2.  **Future projections:** A simulation approach to evaluate\n    projections against abundance thresholds (the probability of falling\n    below either 50%, 25%, or 12.5% of the current population size).\n\n## Methods Outline\n\nThis assessment was performed in a **Bayesian framework** with four main\ncomponents: nesting data imputation, nesting trend analysis, population\nviability analysis, and incorporation of fishery take into the PVA (the\n\"take model\" component). The Bayesian framework is a statistical method\nfor combining a prior probability (existing knowledge) with new data\n(likelihood) to produce a revised posterior probability. Instead of\nusing just a single estimate for a PVA, it provides a posterior\ndistribution that quantifies the uncertainty of parameters.\n\n### 1. Imputing monthly nest counts\n\nSome months were missing from the leatherback dataset, so we used a\nBayesian hierarchical model to impute the missing monthly nest counts.\nThis assumes that the dataset contains observed nests, but these values\ndo not fully capture the true number of nests, as not all nests were\nobserved. The relationship between the monthly nest counts recorded on\nthe beach in natural log space ($\\text{y}_{t,m}$) and the natural log of\nthe true number of nests $\\text{X}_{t,m}$ will be explained below:\n\nWe model the natural logarithm (natural log) of monthly counts at a\nnesting beach as an auto-regressive model. $$\n\\text{u}_{t,m} = \\text{s}_{t,m} + \\text{X}_{t-1,m-1}\n$$ $\\text{u}_{t,m}$ is the mean of the natural log of the true number of\nnests at time $t$ of month $m$, $\\text{s}_{t,m}$ is the \"slope\"\nparameter at time $t$, which is defined by month ($m$ = 1 to 12).\n$\\text{X}_{t-1,m}$ is the natural log of the true nest count at time\n$t - 1$. While month index $m$ corresponds to sequential months in each\nnesting season (e.g. months 1 through 12), the time index starts at the\nfirst month of the time series and increases monthly throughout all\nyears in the time series.\n\nThe state-space $\\text{X}_{t,m}$ is modeled with a normal distribution\nwith the mean $\\text{u}_{t,m}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_X$, which\nwas assumed to be constant over time. $$\n\\text{X}_{t,m} \\text~N(\\text{u}_{t,m},\\sigma_X)\n$$ Observations $\\text{y}_{t,m}$ are modeled with another normal\ndistribution with standard deviation $\\sigma_y$. also assumed to be\nconstant over time. $$\n\\text{y}_{t,m} \\text~N(\\text{X}_{t,m},\\sigma_y)\n$$ The slope $\\text{s}_{t,m}$ parameters are modeled with the discrete\nFourier series y acknowledging the periodicity of nesting. For Jamursba\nMedi, a 12-month period captures the single summer peak in nesting,\nwhereas the summer and winter peaks of nesting in Wermon are captured by\na 6-month period. $$\n\\text{s}_{t,m} = \\beta_1 * cos(2\\pi(\\frac{m}{period})) + \\beta_2 * sin(2\\pi(\\frac{m}{period}) \n$$ The two coefficients ($\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$) were estimated from\nthe data. The annual number of nests for each season (April through\nMarch; $X_T$) are computed as the sum of estimated true monthly log\nnumbers of nests ($\\text{X}_{t,m}$), derived from imputed log observed\nnest counts ($\\text{y}_{t,m}$). $$\nX_T = \\sum{exp(\\text{X}_{.,m}})\n$$ $\\text{X}_{.,m}$ indicates all $t$ values from $m$ = 1 to $m$ = 12.\n\nPrior distributions for the parameters are not flat but with large\nuncertainties in the natural log space. Normal distributions with mean =\n0 and variance = 1 are used for the two parameters for the Fourier\ndiscrete function ($\\beta_1, \\beta_2$), whereas gamma distributions with\nthe shape parameter = 2 and rate parameter = 0.5 are used for the\nstandard deviation parameters for the process ($\\sigma_X$) and\nobservation ($\\sigma_y$) models.\n\n### 2. Trend analysis (retrospective)\n\nPopulation growth rates are estimated using a stochastic\ndensity-independent exponential growth model applied to nest count data\n(Boyd et al. 2017[^1], Holmes et al. (2007)[^2]. $$\nN_j = \\text{N}_{j-1}e^r\n$$ $N_j$ is the number of Annual Nesters in the year $j$, $r$ is the\ninstantaneous population growth rate (i.e. long-term annual trend), and\n$e^r$ = $\\lambda$ (i.e., \"lambda\", the finite rate of increase for the\npopulation).\n\n[^1]: Boyd, C., D. P. DeMaster, R. S. Waples, E. J. Ward, and B. L.\n    Taylor. 2017. Consistent extinction risk assessment under the US\n    Endangered Species Act. Conservation Letters 10:328-336.\n\n[^2]: Holmes EE, Sabo JL, Viscido SV, Fagan WF. 2007. A statistical\n    approach to quasi‐extinction forecasting. Ecology Letters.\n    10(12):1182-1198.\n\nThis model is common for long-lived, slow-growing, late-maturing species\nsuch as sea turtles, whose populations have been depleted to relatively\nlow levels. The assumption of density-independence could be evaluated in\nfuture by running a density-dependent model (e.g. Gompertz model), which\nwould allow the population to reach carrying capacity at some point in\nthe future.\n\nThe data inputs to the model were the time series of Annual Nesters, or\nthe number of females arriving on a beach to nest each year. These were\nderived from observed nest counts, by dividing each nest count by mean\nclutch frequency (i.e. the mean number of clutches per nesting female in\na nesting season). This static conversion does not affect the estimation\nprocess, but puts results into management-relevant terms. The number of\nAnnual Nesters summed across one remigration interval (i.e. the number\nof years between nesting events of the same female) yields a snapshot of\nthe Total Nesters in the population.\n\nThe trend estimates here are better interpreted as long-term annual\ntrends in the number of nesters, rather than the true population growth\nrates. This is because the model relies exclusively on nest count data,\nnesters only represent a small portion of the total population that\nincludes males and immature turtles of both sexes, and assuming true\npopulation growth rates would require the assumption of a stable age\ndistribution, for which no data exists.\n\nThe exponential growth rate was transformed into natural log space and\nsolved for the population growth rate: $$\nln(N_j) = ln(\\text{N}_{j-1}) + r\n$$ $$\nr = ln(N_j) - ln(\\text{N}_{j-1})\n$$ Following Boyd et al. (2017)[^3], we construct a Bayesian state-space\nmodel (BSSM) from the natural log version of the exponential population\ngrowth equation. The BSSM allows for estimation of process variation\n(i.e., environmental and demographic variability) and observation\nuncertainty (i.e., imperfect data collection) and provides posterior\ndistributions (i.e., parameter estimates with probability distributions)\nwhich are useful for conveying uncertainty in management applications.\n\n[^3]: Boyd, C., D. P. DeMaster, R. S. Waples, E. J. Ward, and B. L.\n    Taylor. 2017. Consistent extinction risk assessment under the US\n    Endangered Species Act. Conservation Letters 10:328-336.\n\nThere are two major components of the BSSM: the process model describing\nthe true number of nesting females each year, and the observation model\nrelating the observed count data to the true number of nesting females.\nThree parameters are estimated: $r$, the instantaneous population growth\nrate, $Q$, the process error variance, and $R$, the observation error\nvariance. The model also provides a predicted count with a probability\ndistribution for each year of observed data. The predicted value for the\nfinal year of observed data is then used as a starting point for future\nprojections.\n\n$$\n\\text{Process equation:}\\quad {T_j = \\text{T}_{j-1} + r + p_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; p_j \\,\\text ~\\, N(0,Q)\n$$ Where $T_j$ is the natural log of the true number of annual nesters\nin year $j$, $r$ is the instantaneous population growth rate, $p_j$ is\nthe process error at year $j$, and $Q$ is the state process (time\ninvariant). The true state variable, $T_j$ is not directly measured for\nthe MP loggerheads nor WP leatherbacks. Instead, nest counts are\nobserved on multiple beaches for each population, and the resulting time\nseries come with various forms of observation uncertainty (i.e., missed\nnests or falsely identified nests). The relationship between the\nobserved data and the corresponding number of true Annual Nesters is\ndefined by a second equation: $$\n\\text{Observation equation:}\\quad {B_j = T_j + o_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; o_j \\,\\text ~\\, N(0,R)\n$$ where $B_j$ is the natural log of the observed nesters, $o_j$ is the\nobservation error at year $j$, and $R$ is the variance of the\nobservation process (time invariant).\n\nFor both NP loggerheads and WP leatherbacks, we define the model to only\nhave one population with multiple time series of observations (i.e.,\nmultiple beaches).This structure best represents the known population\ndynamics of genetic similarity and exchange of individuals across the\nstudied beaches.\n\nHowever, the basic model can be expanded to accommodate multiple state\nvectors, representing several populations and multiple time series\n(Hinrichsen and Holmes 2009[^4]): $$\n\\text{Process equation:}\\quad {T_j = \\text{T}_{j-1} + r + p_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; p_j \\,\\text ~\\, MVN(0,Q_j)\n$$ $$\n\\text{Observation equation:}\\quad {B_j = Z +T_j + a + o_j} \\quad \\text{where}\\; o_j \\,\\text ~\\, MVN(0,R_j)\n$$ where $Q_j$ is the process variance-covariance matrix, $R_j$ is the\nobservation variance-covariance matrix, $Z$ is a matrix that maps sets\nof time series to the set of state vectors, and $a$ is a vector of\nscaling parameters. The multivariate setting would allow the analysis of\neach time series as an individual population.\n\n[^4]: Hinrichsen R, Holmes EE. 2009. Using multivariate state-space\n    models to study spatial structure and dynamics. Spatial\n    Ecology.145-166.\n\nPosterior distributions of the model parameters are numerically derived\nusing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in JAGS (Plummer,\n2003[^5]; 2017[^6]).The MCMC simulations are based on 10,000 samples of\n2 chains. Every other sample was retained to reduce auto-correlation,\nand the first 1000 samples of each chain were discarded as burn-in.\n\n[^5]: Plummer M. 2003. Jags: A program for analysis of bayesian\n    graphical models using Gibbs sampling. Proceedings of the 3rd\n    international workshop on distributed statistical computing. Vienna,\n    Austria.\n\n[^6]: Plummer M. 2017. Jags version 4.3.0 user manual.\n    http://mcmc-jagssourceforgenet/.\n\nFrom the model outputs, we are most interested in $r$, the annual\npopulation growth rate, $Q$, the process variance, and\n$\\text{T}_{final}$, the estimated true log Annual Nesters for the final\nyear of observed data. Posterior distributions of Annual Nesters for the\nfinal found years of data are used to estimate current abundance: $$\n\\text{N}_{current} = \\frac{RI * (e^{\\text{T}_{final}})+(e^{\\text{T}_{final-1}})+(e^{\\text{T}_{final-2}})+(e^{\\text{T}_{final-3}})}{4}\n$$ where $RI$ is the remigration interval for the population and\n$\\text{N}_{final}$ is the median Annual Nesters estimated for the final\nyear of data, $\\text{N}_{final-1}$ is for the second to final year of\ndata, and so on. This serves as a snapshot of Total Reproductive Females\nin the population, and assumes no mortaily of adults females during the\n$RI$ period.\n\n### 3. Trend analysis: future projections\n\nPVA projections use a simulation approach with 10,000 runs for each\nspecies. Each projection is initialized in its starting year with a\npaired draw from the MCMC samples (joint posterior distribution) for (1)\nAnnual Nesters ($N_0$ = $\\text{N}_{final}$), (2) instantaneous\npopulation growth rate ($r$), (3) process error variance ($Q$) from the\nfinal data year of the historic trend analysis. For each subsequent year\nin the projection, a new $r$ and $Q$ are drawn as pairs from the MCMC\nsamples to make the projections dynamic. Pulling paired draws from the\nMCMC samples reflects the inter-annual variation in the biology of the\nspecies, but also constrains parameter values to realistic combinations\nand therefore keeps the uncertainty in the projections reasonable.\n\nProjections can be evaluated against abundance thresholds. Here, the\nprobability of falling below 50%, 25%, and 12.5% of current population\nsize ($N_0$) is calculated at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year time steps by\nsumming the number of projections below the thresholds at the given time\nstep and dividing by the total number of projections (10,000). Mean,\nmedian, and 95% confidence limits of number of years to reach the\nthreshold are calculated for simulations that fall below a given\npopulation threshold, and the 100-year timestep simulation.\n\n### 4. Incorporating fishery interactions into the model\n\nIn principle, the incorporation of fisheries interactions into the PVA\nprojections is simple: during the calculation of the number of females\nin the next time step ($\\text{N}_{j+1}$), the number of females in the\ncurrent time step ($N_j$) is reduced by the incidental take in the\ncurrent time step ($F_j$) and multiplied by the finite population growth\nrate ($\\lambda$, = $e^r$). $$\n\\text{N}_{j+1} = (N_j - F_j) * e^r\n$$ Therefore, the challenge comes from converting the incidental take of\na given species (comprised of various lengths, ages, life stages, and\nsexes) to adult nester equivalents (ANE).\n\n**1. Predicting anticipated take levels:** The first goal is to generate\nthe number and characteristics of the anticipated turtles that will be\ntaken in each year. The number of turtles is referred to as the\nanticipated take level (ATL). Each year's ATL was drawn from a\nConway-Maxwell Poisson distribution (CMP), a two-parameter version of\nthe Poisson distributions that includes a scale parameter $\\nu$.\n$\\mu_{s,j}$ is the mean of the CMP distribution, and $s$ is one of three\nwithin-year segments which are summed to produce the total annual ATL\n(McCracken 2018[^7]). $$\n\\text{ATL}_{j} \\; \\text~ \\sum^{3}_{s=1}{CMP(\\mu_{s,j},\\nu_{s,j})}\n$$ Each individual in the annual ATL receives (1) a length and fishery\nmortality from a bivariate normal distribution, (2) a back-calculated\nage with years until maturity based on a von Bertalanffy growth model,\n(3) juvenile survival rate, (4) sex, and (5) a remigration interval.\n\n[^7]: McCracken ML. 2018. Hawaii permitted shallow-set longline fishery\n    estimated anticipated take level for Endangered Species Act listed\n    species. In: NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Science Center, editor.\n    Honolulu, HI USA\n\n**2. Lengths and fishery mortality.** Based on historic incidental take,\na bivariate normal distribution is used to generate lengths in\nlogarithmic space and assign fishery mortality in logit space.\n$\\theta_{L,j}$ is a linear function of the annual incidental take\n($F_j$) with intercept $a_0$ and slope $a_1$, and $\\sum$ is the\nvariance-covariance matrix with variances $\\sigma_L^2$ and $\\sigma_D^2$\nfor the log lengths (log($L_k$)) and logit assigned fishery mortality\n(logit($D_k$)) to have correlated draws. The parameters of the\nmultivariate normal distribution\n($a_0, a_1, \\sigma_L, \\sigma_D, \\rho_{L,D}$) are solved for in a\nBayesian framework using STAN via RStan with 7,500 simulations per chain\n(5,000 burn-in, 2,500 retained) with 4 chains. $$\n\\left( \\frac{log(L_k)}{logit(D_k)} \\right) \\;\\text~MVN\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{L,j}}{\\theta_D},\\;\\scriptstyle\\sum\\;\\right)\n$$ $$\n\\theta_{L,j} = a_0 + a_1F_j\n$$\n\n$$\n\\scriptstyle\\sum = \\left[\\frac {\\sigma_L^2}{}{\\rho_{L,d}{}} \\right]\n$$ $$\n\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathrm{\\sigma_L^2} & \\mathrm{{\\rho_{L,D}}{\\sigma_{L}{\\sigma_{D}} \\\\\n\\mathrm{{\\rho_{L,D}}{\\sigma_L}{\\sigma_D}} & \\mathrm{\\sigma_D^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3. Age and stage.** From all lengths of historically taken turtles, a\nvon Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) is used to calculate the expected\nlength at age across the range of lengths for each species. Using the\nVBGM for each species, the age at maturity ($A_{mat}$) was assumed to\ncorrespond to a length of 97.5% of the maximum asymptotic maximum length\n($L_\\infty$). Turtles with ages less than $A_{mat}$ or lengths less than\n97.5% of ($L_\\infty$) are considered immature. Years until maturity are\ncalculated for all turtles as $Y_k = A_{mat} - {A_k}$, where $A_k$ is\nthe age of the $k$th individual.\n\n**4. Remigration interval, juvenile survival, and sex.** In\ndeterministic runs, each individual in the anticipated take is assigned\nthe mean remigration interval ($RI$) and the mean juvenile survival\n($\\phi$). In stochastic runs, each individual's $RI$ is drawn from a\ndistribution (CMP for leatherbacks, truncated normal for loggerheads)\nand their juvenile survival is drawn from a normal distribution. The sex\nof each animal is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution for the\nprobability of being female.\n\n**5. ANE calculation.** Adults in the anticipated take are given ANEs\nof 1. Juvenile ANEs are calculated by projecting the juvenile survival\nover the number of years to maturity, and dividing by remigration\ninterval. The stochastic nature of sex ratio and fishery mortality are\napplied to adjust the individual ANE. The probability of an individual\ntaken by a fishery dying is used with a Bernoulli distribution to\nsimulate whether an individual dies. Therefore, the ANE of the $k$th\nindividual is computed such that when the individual was a juvenile,\nfemale, and ended up dying, ANE was defined as the first equation below.\nHowever, when the individual was adult and either male or ends up alive,\nthe ANE equals 0.\n\n$$\nANE_k = \\frac{\\phi_J^{Y_k}}{RI}\n$$ $$\nANE_{realized,k} = \\{{{\\frac{\\phi_J^{Y_k}}{RI}, Stage = J}\\atop{1 \\times Sex \\times Discard, Stage = A}}\n$$ **5. Historical ANE imputation.** To account for the historical\nimpact on the population growth rates, ANE is also calculated\nhistorically. Each turtle's length is used to generate a likely age,\nstage, and years to maturity. Juveniles' years to maturity are rounded\nto the nearest year, and adults are assumed to be nesting in the year of\ntheir fishery interaction. $Y_F$ is the year incidental take occurred,\n$Y_k$ is the yeras to maturity, RI is the remigration interval (rounded\nto 3 years). The survival probability between each nesting year has to\nbe accounted for so that the initial ANE is adjusted, where $\\phi_J$ and\n$\\phi_A$ are juvenile and adult survival rates, $PF$ is the proportion\nfemales, and $D$ is the assigned fishery mortality. $$\nY_{nest,k} = \\{{{Y_F+Y_k, y=1}\\atop{Y_{nest,k}-1+RI, y>1}}\n$$ $$\nANE_{k,j} = \\{{{{\\phi_J^{Nest_1}}\\times{PF} \\times D_k, y = 1}\\atop{{\\phi_A^{RI}, y>1}}}\n$$ **6. Take calculation.** After converting all individuals to ANEs,\ntake ($F_j$) from the earlier equation is substituted out for the\nsummation of the individual ANEs in a given year. To account to process\nvariance $Q$ from the trend analysis, the first equation below is\nmodified to draw $N_{j+1}$ from a normal distribution. The modified\npopulation growth model presented below is used as the basis for the\nfuture projections described above to produce future scenarios with take\nincorporated. $$\n\\text{N}_{j+1} = (N_j - ANE_{realized,j}) * e^r\n$$ $$\n\\text{N}_{j+1} = N((N_j - ANE_{realized,j}) * e^r, Q)\n$$\n\n### 5. Modeling assumptions\n\n**Imputation:**\n\n1.  The true number of nests per month is distributed normally, where\n    the monthly means can be modeled with a discrete Fourier series with\n    a fixed annual frequency. In other words, the number of peaks within\n    a year is constant over the years. The variance around the means is\n    assumed constant over the years.\n\n2.  We used an autoregressive model with a lag of one month (AR1 model)\n    where the relationship between the numbers of nests in two months is\n    modeled by the Fourier series. We assume this model sufficiently\n    captures the cyclical nature of nesting throughout the year.\n\n**Trend:**\n\n1.  The proportion of total nests observed on a given beach is constant\n    through time.\n\n2.  The time series of observed number of annual nesters are\n    representative of the populations, as are the population growth\n    rates observed for nesters. Note that index beaches are typically\n    identified for long-term monitoring because they represent the\n    population well.\n\n3.  The clutch frequency is constant through time.\n\n4.  The population growth rate is density-independent for each species\n    (i.e., no carrying capacity or Allee effects in the timeframe\n    considered).\n\n5.  The population growth rate is the same across the different beaches\n    for each species (i.e., there is a single biological process\n    resulting in a single trend).\n\n6.  The process and observation variances are estimable (with so few\n    beaches, the prior has a lot of influence).\n\n7.  The index beaches in both Japan and Indonesia were observed with\n    constant effort or were effort-corrected by the data collectors\n    prior to being provided to PIFSC to form the time series used in\n    these analyses.\n\n8.  The remigration interval is constant through time.\n\n**Projections:**\n\n1.  The population will face the same threats in the future as it did in\n    the past. The PVA applies the population growth rate from the past,\n    which was influenced by some particular magnitude of threats, to the\n    future trajectory of the population. It does not account for the\n    impacts of new or increasing threats, such as the loss of nesting\n    habitat from climate change.\n\n**Take model:**\n\n1.  The anticipated take level (ATL) is constant through time and\n    independent of fishery effort. This assumption was made by\n    McCracken (2018) when generating the ATLs for the fishery.\n\n2.  The distribution of turtles’ sizes and post-interaction mortalities\n    in the past is representative of what will be encountered in the\n    future. We make this assumption when we use the fisheries observer\n    data to inform characteristics of future turtles taken by the\n    fishery, and do so because these are the best available data for the\n    task.\n\n3.  The life history parameters are indicative of the populations of\n    interest and are estimated accurately. Specifically, Amat(age at\n    maturity) is 0.975 of Linf (asymptotic length; average length of\n    mature females).\n\n4.  Turtles will nest immediately once they reach maturity.\n\n### 6. Conservation implications\n\nWe made a number of decisions in the analyses that were inherently\nconservative for the turtle species in question (i.e., likely inflated\nthe mortality relative to the true). We highlight those here to provide\ncontext for interpretation:\n\n1.  We applied the entire anticipated take for the fishery in future\n    years to the index beaches for which we had data; however, those\n    index beaches represent only 52% and 75% of the nesting populations\n    for loggerheads and leatherbacks, respectively. Assessing the impact\n    of the entire take on the index beach populations rather than the\n    full populations is conservative for the species.\n\n2.  The Bayesian trend analysis accounts for the parameter uncertainty\n    by incorporating estimated uncertainty of demographic parameters.\n    Consequently, we found large uncertainty around the estimated\n    population growth rate (r), which resulted in greater or lesser\n    chance of recovering than what was found from a frequentist\n    approach. This finding provides an accurate assessment of the\n    projected population given what we know about the population.\n\n3.  The anticipated take level is biased high (the CMP distribution\n    tends to draw ATLs that are higher than the take levels observed in\n    previous years).\n\n4.  In calculating Adult Nester Equivalents (ANEs) in our historical\n    analysis of fishery impacts (see Historical ANE Imputation), we\n    assume that nesters would have repeatedly returned to nest at a\n    constant remigration interval with an annual probability of survival\n    equal to 0.89 for leatherbacks and 0.90 for loggerheads. However,\n    for loggerheads, Japanese colleagues have indicated that nesters\n    have a relatively low probability of being observed nesting in\n    future years after their initial sighting (approximately 0.30),\n    suggesting potentially high threats in the marine environment. If\n    this is true, then the ANE values in our historical analysis (see\n    Historical ANE Imputation) are inflated compared to the true ANE\n    values (i.e., we added back loggerhead nesters to the population\n    when in reality they had a low chance of surviving to the next\n    nesting season).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
